Snipping Lens is a cross-platform application that automatically detects when you take screenshots and searches them using Google Lens for quick image lookup, and text extraction and translation.

## Usage

### Taking Screenshots

**Windows:**

- Use Win+Shift+S, or left-click the tray icon.
- Screenshots are automatically detected and opened in Google Lens.

### Tray Icon Actions

- **Left-click**: Takes a screenshot according to the system's snipping tool or equivalent.
- **Right-click**: Show context menu with options:
  - **Open App**: Opens Snipping Lens main window.
  - **Exit**: Close the application.

## Requirements

- Internet connection for Google Lens.

### Windows

- Windows 10 or later.

## FAQ

### Where are my screenshots uploaded? Are they stored permanently?

Screenshots are uploaded to [Litterbox](https://litterbox.catbox.moe/), a free and anonymous image hosting service, solely for the purpose of generating a URL that can be used with Google Lens. Images uploaded to Litterbox are not stored permanently, they automatically expire and are deleted after 1 hour. No user information is attached to the upload, and the application does not keep any record of your screenshots.

### Why not use the locally stored image to query Google Lens?

Simplicity, getting an image from user's clipboard and uploading it to a file hosting site is more straightforward than figuring out where the image is saved on the device for each operating system.

I'm sure you're worried about privacy, but you shouldn't be uploading confidential information to Google in the first place anyway.

### Limitations & Longevity

As long as Litterbox returns the expected response (a direct image URL) and as long as the Google Lens endpoint `https://lens.google.com/uploadbyurl?url=<uploaded_image_url>` still exists and works, this program will continue to function as intended. If either service changes or is discontinued, the program's automatic search feature may no longer work.

## Building from Source

For Windows: `setup_win.vbs` already builds the application from source using its own Python 3.10 environment. If you want to use your own Python environment, you need to adjust the path inside the scripts in the bin/win folder.
