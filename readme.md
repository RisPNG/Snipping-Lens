## Usage

### Taking Screenshots

- Screenshots are automatically detected and opened in Google Lens

- **Right-click**: Show context menu with options:
  - **Pause/Resume**: Temporarily disable/enable automatic detection
  - **Show Logs**: View application logs in a text editor

### Pause/Resume Feature

Use the Pause feature when you need to take screenshots without automatically opening them in Google Lens (e.g., for saving or editing).

## System Requirements

### Windows
- Windows 10 or later
- Internet connection for Google Lens

### Linux Mint Debian Edition
- Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE)
- xclip package
- gnome-screenshot package
- Internet connection for Google Lens

## Privacy & Security

- Screenshots are temporarily uploaded to Catbox.moe (a free image hosting service) to generate Google Lens URLs
- Temporary files are automatically deleted after processing
- No screenshots are stored permanently by this application
- The application only processes screenshots taken after snipping tools are detected running

## Troubleshooting

### Linux: "xclip not found" error
Install xclip:
```bash
sudo apt install xclip
```

### Linux: App not showing in system tray
Make sure you have a system tray applet installed:
```bash
sudo apt install xfce4-indicator-plugin
```

Or use the XApp Status Applet (pre-installed on Linux Mint).

### Windows: App not starting automatically
The application should automatically add itself to Windows startup. If not, you can manually add it through:
1. Win+R ‚Üí `shell:startup`
2. Copy the executable to the startup folder

### General: Screenshots not being detected
1. Check if the application is paused (right-click tray icon)
2. View logs (right-click tray icon ‚Üí Show Logs)
3. Ensure you're using supported screenshot tools
