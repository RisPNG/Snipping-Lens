## FAQ

### Where are my screenshots uploaded? Are they stored permanently?

Screenshots are uploaded to [Litterbox](https://litterbox.catbox.moe/), a free and anonymous image hosting service, solely for the purpose of generating a URL that can be used with Google Lens. Images uploaded to Litterbox are not stored permanentlyâ€”they automatically expire and are deleted after 1 hour. No user information is attached to the upload, and the application does not keep any record of your screenshots.

### Limitations & Longevity

As long as Litterbox returns the expected response (a direct image URL) and as long as the Google Lens endpoint `https://lens.google.com/uploadbyurl?url=<uploaded_image_url>` still exists and works, this program will continue to function as intended. If either service changes or is discontinued, the program's automatic search feature may no longer work.

## Building from Source

Python 3.11 is recommended. If you use the provided installation scripts (`build-windows.bat` or `build-linux.sh`), all required dependencies will be installed automatically.
