## FAQ

### Where are my screenshots uploaded? Are they stored permanently?

Screenshots are uploaded to [Litterbox](https://litterbox.catbox.moe/), a free and anonymous image hosting service, solely for the purpose of generating a URL that can be used with Google Lens. Images uploaded to Litterbox are not stored permanently‚Äîthey automatically expire and are deleted after 1 hour. No user information is attached to the upload, and the application does not keep any record of your screenshots.

## Limitations & Longevity

As long as Litterbox returns the expected response (a direct image URL) and as long as the Google Lens endpoint `https://lens.google.com/uploadbyurl?url=<uploaded_image_url>` still exists and works, this program will continue to function as intended. If either service changes or is discontinued, the program's automatic search feature may no longer work.

## Troubleshooting

> **Note:** If you use the provided installation scripts (`build-windows.bat` or `build-linux.sh`), all required dependencies will be installed automatically. The following troubleshooting steps are only relevant if you install manually or on an unsupported system.

### Linux: "xclip not found" error
Install xclip:
```bash
sudo apt install xclip
```

### Linux: App not showing in system tray
Make sure you have a system tray applet installed:
```bash
sudo apt install xfce4-indicator-plugin
```

Or use the XApp Status Applet (pre-installed on Linux Mint).
